## Projects Overview

### 1. **Math Game in 1 Minute 🧠💡**
**Challenge yourself and test your math skills in this fun, fast-paced game!**
- **How it works:** 
  - The game runs for **1 minute**. 
  - You'll be presented with **2 random numbers** and a **random operation**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

  - Your goal: Answer as many questions as possible in 1 minute. 
  - When time is up, it will show your **score** (how many questions you answered) and **accuracy** (how many answers were correct).

**Requirements:**  
Run the code in the console using command line.

### 2. **English - Traditional Chinese - Simplified Chinese Translation 🌍🈳**
**Want to practice languages? This program lets you translate between English and Chinese!**
- **How it works:** 
  - Input English or Chinese words or sentences, and the program will print out the translated text.

### 3. **Check Your French Pronunciation 🇫🇷🎤**
**Improve your French skills with this interactive voice recognition tool!**
- **How it works:**
  - Input a French word or sentence.
  - The program will ask you to **speak it** out loud (using your microphone).
  - It will listen to your pronunciation and give you feedback. If you don’t say it correctly, it will ask you to try again until you nail it! 🎯

**Requirements:**  
Run the code in the console using command line.

### 4. **Highest Frequency Word Finder 🔍📖**
